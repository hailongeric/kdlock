# Minimal whole-VMA munmap body

Status: implementation prepared for a separate `kdmm4` kernel; compilation and
live correctness are pending. The `kdmm2` advice and `kdmm3` anonymous first-write
milestones remain preserved. This stage is correctness only; performance, p95,
the seven mutex regressions and broad stress remain deferred.

## Reviewed boundary

A virtual memory area (VMA) describes one address range. The first supported
case removes one complete, isolated, private anonymous VMA of at most 16 pages,
with `MADV_NOHUGEPAGE`, no memory-account charge, callback, userfaultfd, memory
policy, name, huge/locked/growing state or reverse-map chain. Writable test VMAs
use `MAP_NORESERVE` to avoid `VM_ACCOUNT`. An MMU notifier is an external consumer
that receives mapping-change callbacks; any notifier subscription is refused.

Initially every top-level page-directory entry (PGD) covering the range must be
absent. This deliberately restricts the path more than merely checking empty
PTEs (leaf page-table entries). Even an empty lower-level table could require
table-free batching on the combiner. With absent PGDs, the original page-table
and TLB (cached address translation) teardown helpers run, but have no page or
table to release. Populated ranges return to the waiter for native teardown.

The actual `__vm_munmap()` entry submits eligible-range calls. The combiner uses
the shared original `do_mas_align_munmap_prepared()` body: it detaches the VMA
from the maple tree (the mapping index), updates counts, runs `unmap_region()`,
and frees the VMA. The ordinary native route calls the same helper without a
prepared reserve. Success requires a real VMA removal; empty-range success or
local continuation is never counted as a delegated body.

## Caller context and resources

Address alignment and `TASK_SIZE` depend on the original caller's thread mode,
so the origin checks them before publication. The captured x86 `arch_unmap()`
is empty. No callback, file operation or user access is admitted remotely.

Maple-tree allocation can depend on the current task's allocation context.
The origin therefore prepares both allocation chains before entering the queue.
An allocation-only helper reads a scalar tree-height hint with `READ_ONCE`; it
never walks a live tree or retains a VMA pointer. Its common allocation routine
is also used by the unchanged native preallocation API. The combiner checks the
actual reserve capacity against the current height under mmap write ownership;
insufficient capacity refuses before any effect. Preparation takes no mmap read
lock, avoiding a second origin waiting behind the first queued writer.

The prepared detach allocation chain and its flags transfer explicitly into
the native helper's local state; no whole packet or traversal state is copied.
The real preallocated stores consume the chains. The origin destroys whatever
remains only after its exact queue node retires, including cancellation/refusal.

## Lock and refusal protocol

Use the existing KD physical mmap writer gate, preallocated per-CPU nodes and
independent OSQ links. OSQ is the optimistic-spin queue for physical acquisition.
A separate munmap delegation tail prevents the preserved advice queue from
interpreting a different request layout. Both queues serialize through the same
actual mmap writer owner. The advice and fault body implementations are unchanged.

Readers stay local and concurrent until an actual writer closes admission and
waits for them to drain. An admitted munmap keeps its single writer acquisition;
the optional native downgrade is disabled for that body. Only the exact physical
owner releases it. A completed remote node is detached before DONE permits its
origin to retire; the head retains its own slot through physical unlock.

Unsupported requests set the munmap entry's sticky native-only flag. A remote
origin validates the exact node, mm, task and physical owner before acknowledging
the refusal. This ACK is for ownership/request retirement, not completion of the
native munmap. After DONE and slot retirement, the original `__vm_munmap()` tail
acquires, optionally downgrades and releases its own lock normally. The combiner
does not wait while arbitrary native callbacks execute on the origin.

Pending fatal cancellation remains linked until the owner consumes it before
body admission, then returns `-EINTR` without removing the VMA. Once admitted,
an error is returned directly and never replayed locally. Bounded cancellation
latency and oversubscribed progress remain unvalidated.

## Planned validation

Use the original `10.176.26.71:2222` MM VM, one writer and serial checks. Verify
different-task completion of real munmap, absence of the actual mapping,
unchanged neighbors, local readers/fault interaction, exact handback/ACK pairs,
sticky refusal, queued cancellation and complete node/resource/module cleanup.
Keep Native controls, advice preservation, first-write preservation, untouched
mmap and fault workloads separate. Preserve every failure and restore recovery.
The [stage record](../../bench/results/10.176.26.71/tests/mm-unmap-body-20261022/README.md)
will record working commands and actual results. No functional pass is claimed
from this prepared implementation.
